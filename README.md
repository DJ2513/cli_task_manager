# CLI Task Manager

I build a CLI Task Manager for myself. This was a big challenge for me beacuse I did not know the first thing about building CLI apps and also I just knew the basics of Golang. 
So why not build a CLI app to learn both at the sam time? For this project I used 100% golang and stored all of the data in a JSON file. In the near future IÂ´m planning to add a mongoose
data base so I can use the program in other laptops also (I think of this as very usefull)

## How did I do it?


## What was the biggest challenge?
